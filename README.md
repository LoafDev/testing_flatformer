Platformer in beta, download if you want

NOTE: In order for the game to work, you need to move dirt.png and Map_1_infdev.csv to level_design. I can't seem to move dirt.png to level_design at github website and I'm lazy to download command-line github.

I want to thanks Clear Code as always for a great tutorial on basic platformer, please support his channel here:
